## Chrome extension to grab netflix subtitles 

### NEED TO BE UPDATE

### Requirements:
- https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/language-learning-with-ne/hoombieeljmmljlkjmnheibnpciblicm?hl=en
- ankiconnect (https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159)
- and offcourse anki desktop app


### Info
I had a problem that I wanted to grab the subtitles from netflix to my anki deck.
So the extension when you click the icon on chrome tab will grab the current subtitles (in my case arabic and german) and send them to anki and create an card for that with a cloze type but it will not be closed without saying which input you want to replace first.

### Install in chrome
- open chrome extensions section 
- enable developer option from the top 
- load unpacked and choose the directory
- after doing anychange just update the extension so chrome pick the changes
